                <p>A teenager athlete who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures known as Curses. In order to protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a sort of death sentence, which has been suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers in order to kill himself and Sukuna at the same time.<br></p>

                    A sorcerer working as a teacher in the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He uses his curse power to control the space around him in innumerable ways. Even though his title of 'The Strongest' is self-proclaimed, most allies and enemies alike never actually dispute the title and generally consider him to be one of the most dangerous people alive. As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and holds high influence in the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki.<br>

                    A high-grade demon curse, considered the undisputed 'King of Curses' due to his raw power and malevolence. According to legend, he was a four-armed demon resembling a human, when in reality, he was the vengeful spirit of a sorcerer from the prime era of jujutsu. Sorcerers of his time were unable to exorcise him however, storing his 20 fingers as cursed charms in hope that one day they would be destroyed. Currently, Sukuna is the "guest" of the body of Yuji Itadori, who agrees to let himself be killed to avoid further massacres. He has expressed notable interest in Megumi Fushiguro's abilities and plans to both regain his power and body. Whenever Sukuna possesses Itadori, characteristic tattoos take form on Itadori's body and two extra eyes open on Itadori's cheeks. Satoru Gojo claims he can beat Sukuna, but the latter has expressed a desire to kill him and his power is such that all other Cursed Spirits are attempting to restore him.<br>
